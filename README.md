# mulesoft_assignment
SQLite database assignment repo

to run the program use following path
mulesoft_assignment/sqlitedatabase/src/sqlitedatabase/run.java

I commented out each demo in the main function. 
And each demo is implemented in the same file as functions and commented for the user to understand.
The databases will be created in the same folder as used by user to run the program 
this program was created in Eclipse IDE
